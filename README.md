## Repository for [A Multi-organ Nucleus Segmentation Challenge](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8880654).

<p align="center">Note: This project is a work-in-progress, and not quite ready for real usage.<br>If you're interested in using it, feel free to ⭐️ the repo so we know!</p>

Dataset can be downloaded from [Grand Challenge Webiste](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/)

Three Segmentation models have been trained:
